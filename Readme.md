Template for blog.andrewsimone.com Ghost CMS.

It's about as sketchy as the CMS. Once Ghost 0.4 is out, I'll update this with all the appropriate tags for full integration. Until then, feel free to hack away with this. 

I should note that this has the CSS for my Typography.com Fonts. You'll want to remove those.
