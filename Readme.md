Template for andrewsimone.com Ghost CMS.

It's about as sketchy as the CMS. Once Ghost 0.4 is out, I'll update this with all the appropriate tags for full integration. Until then, feel free to hack away with this. 

I should not that this has the CSS for my personal Typography.com Fonts. You'll want to remove those.
